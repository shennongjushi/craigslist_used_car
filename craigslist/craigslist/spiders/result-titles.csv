https://austin.craigslist.org/cto/6162175861.html,1993 Plymouth GrandVoyager LE,1500,"
        
I am selling my 1993 Plymouth Grand Voyager - it has been extremely well taken care of.  I am the original owner of it.  It has 156,350 miles on it.  The interior is very clean and the exterior has been painted once and has some wear due to its age -- Its almost 25 years old but doenst look it at all.  It runs well - I have done the maintaince on it - using synthetic oil (royal Purple), synthetic Transmission fluid (Amsoil) as well as Purolater air and oil filters.

The good:  
1.)  Has 4 Good Year Tires - 3 are brand new!
2.)  A/C is very cold! Both rear and Front are separate controls
3.)  Interior is extremely clean
4.)  Seats are very clean - no stains on any of them!
5.)  Floor is also very clean  - have floor mats
6.)  The inside roof liner was replaced about 5 years ago and looks BRAND new still
7.)  This van get right at 20 mpg (was 19 when the console used to work)
8.)  Has a roof rack - not shown in picture as I took it off
9.)  Has premium sound system that works great!

Due to its age there are a few issues with it that someone with some time and more mechanical expertise could resolve- I just dont use the car anymore and dont have the time to fix the issues:

1.)  Slight rust hole at the back by the tailgate -could easily be filled in to seal
2.)  A/C blower sometimes wants to blow on your feet even when you have it set to blow on your phase
3.)  The radio works - but the LCD cant be read
4.)  The van had a trip navigation console - told you  mpg, miles till you are out of gas, temp, etc.. stopped working
5.)  The fuel gauge doesnt work properly - but you can use the trip odometer to determine when you need to fill up.
6.)  Shocks seems to have bottomed out and need to be replaced - it has original shocks and struts on it.


Thats the good and the bad - its a great van - I just dont need it anymore and figured someone could still get some good usage out of it than me.  Its been sitting on my driveway for 6 months with very little use.    ",1993,Plymouth,Grand,good,6,gas,156350,full-size,clean,automatic,van,,

1999 GMC Jimmy, runs well
 SLT model, automatic, 4WD, Leather seats, New tires in 2015 hardly used since
 ""Champagne"" color (aka silver)

 Mileage: 140,850

 Single-owner, no accidents. I purchased this as my first car in 2000 and have maintained it ever since. Includes the original brochure and owner's manual from when I originally purchased it. 

 My favorite features that they don't make in current SUVs are the ""pop window"" in the back door hatch, which makes it easy to transport larger or extra-long items like lumber when needed. Also, the back seats lie down to make the back flat for spacious hauling capacity when needed, without needing to remove any back seat parts.

 FEATURES:
 4WD
 Air Bags - Next Generation driver and front passenger
 Air Conditioning capable - automatic electronic climate control (currently not working, but never tried to fix it once it went out)
 Assist Handles for front and rear passenger entry and exit
 Audio Systems: AM/FM stereo with CD player, random select, speed sensitive volume, Theftlock security device, seek and scan, automatic tone control, digital clock, and premium 6-speaker system
 Brakes - four-wheel disc with antilock braking system
 Cargo Net in rear compartment
 Cargo Shade in rear - retractable
 Child Security door locks
 Cigarette Lighter
 Console (Floor) - between front seats, with coin tray, CD storage space, and two cupholders
 Cruise Control
 Cupholders - two in center console, and one in each door panel
 Gauges - speedometer, tachometer, odometer, trip odometer, voltmeter, engine temperature, fuel level and oil pressure
 Headlamp warning - lights-on warning tone when ignition off
 Heater/Defogger, including side window defoggers - heat works EXCELLENTLY
 Leather Seats
 Luggage rack - roof-mounted 200-pound capacity
 Mirrors - dual electric control with heated and light sensitive feature
 Power Package: power windows, door locks, and dual electric-control outside mirrors
 Power Steering
 Retained Accessory Power: allows operation of power windows, radio, power sunroof, and overhead console after the vehicle is turned off (operation continues for 20 minutes afterward)
 Safety Belts - all seats
 Seats (Front)- high-back reclining front bucket seats, leather, with 2-way power lumbar support adjuster, 8-way power driver's seat with power recliner and center console
 Seats (Rear) - split folding bench with folding outboard head restraints
 Steering wheel - leather-wrapped deluxe 4-spoke steering wheel in Graphite, tilt capability and cruise control
 Sunroof (power) - open and tilt feature, sunshade, and wind deflector
 Sun visors - with driver and passenger-side illuminated visor mirrors and side extenders
 Theft Deterrent System/Alarm
 Tint - deep-tinted Solar-Ray glass on all windows except windshield, driver, and front passenger window
 Tire - new tires installed right before I stopped driving it, likely drove it <100 miles since then
 original spare included
 Tow/Haul switch - with tow hitch installed, and six-wire trailering harness
 Transmission - automatic, with push-button electronic full-time AWD, on-demand 4WD and neutral feature; Electronic 4-speed automatic with overdrive
 Windshield wipers - front and rear intermittent wipers and washers

 Gas gauge and dash lights currently not working (went out a few years ago) - probably an easy fix, but I continued to drive it without issue for years. 

Ran fine up until I stopped driving it regularly in 2014, then starting this last year due to lack of use it needed to be jumped each time to start it up. Most recently (last few months), when we jump it- the motor will turn and *almost* start but not quite. Likely needs a new battery, or maybe an alternator. Would probably need a standard tune-up as well since it hasn't been used in a while. 

Selling for $1500.

Just in time for spring and summer! 1973 Jeep CJ5 -

I'm sorry to have to sell it but I just don't have the time or space for it anymore. It has the AMC 304 V8 with CA smog headers and 2 barrel carb, Edelbrock air filter, runs great! 3 speed transmission, with Dana transfer case. All stock, no lift, 33"" Yokohama A/T's, polished aluminum wheels. Rhino-liner grey exterior - you don't have to worry about scratches! The inside is rhino lined black. Front seats are out of a Jeep Cherokee, rear seat is a CJ seat, and it has seatbelts for all seats. The interior is in good condition. Has a CD deck with USB, SD card, and aux inputs, Sony waterproof speakers on the back fenders - sounds great. LED taillights, mounts for 2 Jerry Cans on the back and spare tire mount, and I'll let the 2 cans in the pictures go with it in the sale. 

It has the original paper ID tag on the dash, and has the VIN/Build plate/fender tag on the firewall under the hood. I believe it is the original engine and transmission as well. This is one of only a few unmolested survivor CJ's around. 

This thing is a lot fun to drive, and crawls great. I brought this thing back from Arizona with me, it spent most of its life in Arizona, so rust is not a big issue on this one. Just a few minor things left on this to make it fully restored, and a great daily driver even if you wanted. 

It currently just has a bikini top on it, and canvas doors. I do have the original white square metal top for it. The original top needs work but could be restored (needs to be sand blasted, painted, and windows put in it). 

Call or text me to come and take a look or ask questions. If I don't answer, leave a message or send a text, and I'll call you back. I'm not always able to answer my phone immediately. Need this toy gone! Thanks!

Been in family since new. 
Ran GREAT before parked. All accessories and AC work great. Sat for 3 months and when we went to drive it again it wouldn't start. We replaced the starter and learned that the engine won't turn over- even by hand. The mechanic working on it did not know what could stop the motor from turning over and we had him return the starter to the parts store. So, the car's current condition: engine wont turn by hand, and there is no starter in it. The issue with the engine is unknown. 

""Rare-ish"" bench seat with column shifter, 120k miles, non smoker car. Needs tires soon. Body is in GREAT shape, with just a few small dings. Maintenance records dating back for years. Title in hand. Price is FIRM...firm.
I cannot help you move the car, must be towed off. 

Come get it before Thursday 8th!!
